#### Check out this little app at [link](http://markdown-preview.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/)
This app had 217 people , mostly my classmates, visited in during 10 weeks of school. We used it to see homeworks given in *.md format by my professor.

Meanwhile, you can use it to see how you README file will look like before pushing to GitHub
